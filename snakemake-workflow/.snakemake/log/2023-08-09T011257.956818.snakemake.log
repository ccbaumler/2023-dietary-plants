CreateCondaEnvironmentException:
The 'mamba' command is not available in the shell /usr/bin/bash that will be used by Snakemake. You have to ensure that it is in your PATH, e.g., first activating the conda base environment with `conda activate base`.The mamba package manager (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is a fast and robust conda replacement. It is the recommended way of using Snakemake's conda integration. It can be installed with `conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba`. If you still prefer to use conda, you can enforce that by setting `--conda-frontend conda`.
